        <p class="mainBody">
            Built by PorkyProductions in April 2021, (de)Motivator was a pet project for hiteacheryouare.
            He asked HedgehogDubz to create him a website that instead of spitting out motivational quote, would create non-montivational quotes.
            HedgehogDubz provided the framework for the website, and some of his code still lives on.
            After many months of continued development, (de)Motivator evolved into the site you know today.
