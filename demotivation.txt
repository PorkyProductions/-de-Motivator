You brought this upon yourself
Only dummies like you are stupid enough to keep clicking this button
Say goodbye to any shred of self-worth you tink you still have
You are stupid. That's it. That's the quote
"Make yourself a fire, and you'll be warm for a few hours, set yourself of fire, and you'll be warn for the rest of your life" Is a good saying; are you cold right now?
