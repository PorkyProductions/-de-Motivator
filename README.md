Hello, and welcome to (de)Motivator's GitHub repo, you stupid idiot!
To download, simply download the code in a .zip format using the big green button. Once that is completed, run the .html file in your browser of choice. 
If you don't understand that, you are probably too dumb to use this app.


ATTN: If you are on our actual website (https://porkyproductions.github.io/-de-Motivator/ by the way), please use the big blue "view on GitHub" button to get to our repo to download the code.
